# Welcome to ACHIEVABLE

Let's get to work. <http://achievable.site/>

Achievable is a productivity tool. It allows you to set timed goals for periods of work. 

Built to help self-taught developers reach their study goals. Achievable is for everyone looking to improve one second at a time. 

**PHP** is used to handle data values selected by the user. These values along with the **JavaScript** for the stopwatch are dynamically scripted. 

The application's aesthetic is an ode to my love of minimalism. Afterall, developer’s can deal with tremendous levels of complexity. When considering this, Achievable is a breath of fresh air. 

I hope this little tool can help you progress toward realizing your goals.

# Reflection


The largest challenge was considering the scope of the project. 

Most of the time I just have an idea and get straight to the code. 

This time I carefully thought about the technologies that I wanted to use. 

Moreover, I considered how the application would scale. 

I kept my code simple. I made sure I could add new features to the project without breaking the code. 

What I enjoyed most about Achievable is its usefulness. Helping users become more productive is satisfying. 

That doesn’t mean the project is perfect. I think it can improve by having user profiles. This way users can track time spent toward a goal over a long period of time. Say a user wants to study for 60 hours in one month. I’d like the user to be able to track their progress across that time. Currently the application is limited to a few hours. 

Overall, however, I am proud of my project. Although it’s not really mine anymore. It is the world’s baby now.
