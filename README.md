# Welcome to ACHIEVABLE

Let's get to work. <http://achievable.site/>

Achievable is a productivity tool. It allows you to set timed goals for periods of work. 

Built to help self-taught developers reach their study goals. Achievable is for everyone looking to improve one second at a time. 

**PHP** is used to handle data values selected by the user. These values along with the **JavaScript** for the stopwatch are dynamically scripted. 

The application's aesthetic is an ode to my love of minimalism. Afterall, developerâ€™s can deal with tremendous levels of complexity. When considering this, Achievable is a breath of fresh air. 

I hope this little tool can help you progress toward realizing your goals.
